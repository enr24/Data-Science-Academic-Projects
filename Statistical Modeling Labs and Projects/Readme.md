# MTH 362
Skill learned in MTH 362 are: Inferential statistical methods, ANOVA, design and analysis of experiments, regression and nonparametric methods (From Creighton University Spring 2023 Catalog). 
All programming work is completed in R.
# Lab 1
Worked with linear regression and used in on data set with information on Penguins and on Club Soccer.
# Lab 2 
Wored with college enrollment information to determine future enrollment at colleges.
# Lab 3 
Worked with data on elephant mating to see if age in male played a role with the probability of mating occuring.
# Lab 4
Used Poisson Model to work with data about the movement of female crabe which had a sattleite attached to them.
# Lab 5
Worked out various word problems to find the canonical link in a given function.
# Lab 6
Worked with data on Moths to determine if their campflauge traits affected the survivial of the fittest theory. Created three different lienar model and ran cofidence interval and chi-square tests on them to determin which on was the best fit.
# Lab 7 
Worked with data on electronic circuts to predict which ones had defects. Learned about Linear Model with Gamma Response to determine which models are likely to have defects.
# Lab 8
Worked with data on demin material for a jeans company to determine how much material will be wasted and which company to go with. Used lienar model and mixed-effects linear model.
# Lab 9
Worked with data on Blood Coagulation times on a variety of animals. Learned how to work with mixed effects model.
# Lab 10
Worked with data on Rat diet trials, where the water they drank had a chemical in it, and researchers wanted to determine if the chemical caused the rat to gain or lose weight. Worked with Linear Models and Mix effects model.
# Project 1
Worked with data on student grades in a math class and wanted to see what were the biggest contributing factors to the students sucess/lack of sucess. Worked with Linear Models
# Project 2
Worked with data to see what contributing factors influced customer satisfaction for. Worked with Linear efect and backwards model.
# Project 3
Worked with data on a drug trial and its effects on memory priming (the idea that exposure to one stimulus may influence a response to a subsequent stimulus, without conscious guidance or intention). Used Linear Model, Poisson Regressions, and Mixed-Effects model to determine which variables played a major role in sucessful priming.
