Skills Learned in MTH 366 are: Topics include supervised learning (regression models, kernel smoothers), unsupervised learning (clustering or principal component analysis), shrinkage models, additive models, and neural networks (Creighton University Catalog). All programming work completed in R.
# Lab 1
Worked with data on Diabtetes Patients who were Pima Indians to try and predict which patients were at risk of being diagnosed with diabetes based on certain factors (Glucose Level,Weight,BMI). Learned to work with the logisitic regression model and what the significance of Kappa and Accuracy are. 
# Lab 2
Worked with data on Bluejays that were spopted near Oberlin College. Learned about a Linear Discriminant Model and Confusion Matrix. Learned about how to determine which other variables have an inlfuence on predicting the Sex of a bird.
# Lab 3
Worked with data on Credit Card holders. Learned to work with the K-nearest neightbors model, and determined how many K's yielded the most optimal model.
# Lab 4
Worked with data on houses in Ames to predict how much a house will cost and what factors influence the selling price. Also worked with data on White Wine to see what factors into a wine being deemed high quality. Learned about the Lasso, Ridge, and Splie Model and hwo to determine which one was more accurate and which one's are considered a better fit. 
# Lab 5
Worked with data on houses in Ames to predict how much a house will cost and what factors influence the selling price. Learned about Mars Model, Target and Featured Engineering.
# Lab 6
Worked with data on glass found at crimes scenes. The goal is to try to identiy they type of glass at a crime scene. Learned about Classififcation Trees and Random Forests.
