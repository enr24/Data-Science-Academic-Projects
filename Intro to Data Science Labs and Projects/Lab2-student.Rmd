A key part of Pokémon Go is using evolutions to get stronger Pokémon, and a deeper understanding of evolutions is key to being the greatest Pokémon Go player of all time. The data set you will be working with for this assignment covers 75 Pokémon evolutions spread across four species. A wide set of variables are provided, allowing a deeper dive into what characteristics are important in predicting a Pokémon’s final combat power (CP).

## Data
The dataset for this assignment can be found as a csv file on BlueLine. The variable descriptions are as follows:

* name: A unique name given to the Pokémon.
* species: The Pokémon’s type, e.g. Pidgey.
* cp: Pre-evolution Combat Power, which is a summary of the Pokémon’s strength for battling prior to the evolution of the Pokémon.
* hp: Pre-evolution Hit Points, which is a summary of how difficult it is to weaken the Pokémon in a battle.
* weight: Pre-evolution weight, in kilograms.
* height: Pre-evolution height, in meters.
* power_up_stardust: Pre-evolution stardust required to power up the Pokémon.
* power_up_candy: Pre-evolution candy required to power up the Pokémon.
* attack_weak: The name of the pre-evolution weaker attack of the Pokémon.
* attack_weak_type: The type of the pre-evolution weaker attack.
* attack_weak_value: The damage done by the pre-evolution weaker attack.
* attack_strong: The name of the pre-evolution stronger attack.
* attack_strong_type: The type of the pre-evolution stronger attack.
* attack_strong_value: The damage done by the pre-evolution stronger attack.
* cp_new: Post-evolution Combat Power.
* hp_new: Post-evolution Hit Points.
* weight_new: Post-evolution weight, in kilograms.
* height_new: Post-evolution height, in meters.
* power_up_stardust_new: Post-evolution stardust required to power up the Pokémon.
* power_up_candy_new: Post-evolution candy required to power up the Pokémon.
* attack_weak_new: The name of the post-evolution weaker attack.
* attack_weak_type_new: The type of the post-evolution weaker attack.
* attack_weak_value_new: The damage done by the post-evolution weaker attack.
* attack_strong_new: The name of the post-evolution stronger attack.
* attack_strong_type_new: The type of the post-evolution stronger attack.
* attack_strong_value_new: The damage done by the post-evolution stronger attack.
* notes: Any additional notes made while collecting the data.

## Exercise: 

For each question, please make corresponding figures as well as several sentences to explain your findings.

1. Calculate the difference in heights pre and post evolution and save this as a new variable. Calculate the percentage of Pokémon that grew during evolution. Also visualize the distribution of change in height by species and provide a discussion of how change in height varies across species. (Include a link to any online examples you use to help.)

The percentage that grew is 100%. Caterpie saw an average change in height of 0.4 inches while Eevee saw an average change in height of about 0.5 inches. Pidgey had the highest average change in height at 0.8 inches while Weedle saw the lowest media at approximately 0.3 inches. Only Eevee and Caterpie had out-liers in the data.


```{r}
pokemon_data <- pokemon %>%
  mutate(height_difference = height_new - height)
ggplot(pokemon_data, aes(x = species ,y = height_difference))+ geom_boxplot(aes(color=species))
```
 
2. Recreate the following plot. (What is the x-axis and y-axis in the plot? Is group information needed? Group information is usually indicated by color or size. Do the main figure first and then add other options like title. )
![](2-pokemon.png)
To replicate the data from the first question, I used a box plot, which shows that indeed all the species have undergone a height change. The advantage of this plot is that we can get a rough sense of the distribution of height changes. The disadvantage here is that we cannot find the median of the data for the various names, which was something that we could easily find with the box-plots.

```{r}
ggplot(pokemon_data, aes(x = height_difference, y = species))+ geom_point(aes(color=species))+
xlab("Species") + 
ylab("Height difference")

```

3. Pick two categorical variables and make a bar plot that depicts the relationship between them. These can be variables from the original data or ones that you create based on the given data.

In this Bar-chart, we are able to see the species, their particular Attack Weak, and how many of the attack_weak show up for each species. For example, Weedle has the weak attack of bug bite show up 10 times and a poison sting 15 times. Pidgey had the attack of Tackle show up approximately 25 time and Quick Attack show up approximately 17 times. Caterpie had the attack of Tackle and Bug bite show up 5 times each. Eevee had Quick Attack show up twice and Tackle show up 4 times. 

```{r}
ggplot(pokemon_data, aes(x = attack_weak)) + geom_bar(aes(color = species), bins = 15)+ 
xlab("Attack Weak Name") +
ylab("Frequency")

```

4. Pick a numerical and a categorical variable, and construct side-by-side box plots depicting the relationship between them.

The numerical category that I selected her was heigh and I was curious how the height and the attack strong were related (if there was any relationship). One example of how what this graph displays is that species with the twister attack had an average height of 0.325 inches. With  all species, the line in the middle of the plot inciate average height. 

```{r}
ggplot(pokemon_data, aes(height)) + geom_boxplot(aes(color = attack_strong))

```

5. Learn something new: violin plots! Read about them at http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_violin.html, and convert your side-by-side box plots from the previous task to violin plots. What do the violin plots reveal that box plots do not? What features are apparent in the box plots but not in the violin plots?

The difference with the violin plot is that they reveal the shape of the distribution of each category, which is something that the box plots fail to reveal. While Box plots may not tell us about the distribution, they do tell us about any out-lairs and 

```{r}
ggplot(pokemon_data, (aes(height, attack_strong))) + geom_violin() + coord_flip()

```
  

6. What characteristics correspond to an evolved Pokemon with a high combat power? You do not need to come up with an exhaustive list, but you should walk through your reasoning for answering this question and include all relevant summary statistics and visualizations.

One possible explanation for an evolved Pokemon with a high combat power could be a increase in height, which shows that the new heights lead to a higher combat power. Another possible explanation for this is that the increase in weight can also possible contribute to a stronger attack. 

```{r}
ggplot(pokemon_data, aes(x = attack_strong_new, y = height_new)) + geom_point(size = 2.5)

ggplot(pokemon_data, aes(x = attack_strong_new , y = weight_new )) + 
geom_point(size = 1)

```
