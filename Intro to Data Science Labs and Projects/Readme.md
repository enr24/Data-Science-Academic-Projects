Intro to statistical data science, using computing tools to gather, manage and analyze large and complex data sets. Topics include data wrangling and formatting, web scraping, data analysis, statistical modeling techniques, text mining and language processing (Creighton University Catalog).
All Programming Work was completed in R.
# Lab 1
Worked with data on Baby Names. Learned about how to program bar graphs and scatter plots. Also learend about how call a dataset and filter it on certain criteria (i.e. a specific name).
# Lab 2
Worked with data on Pokemon figures. Learned how use the mutate function and when its approriate to use certain graphs (i.e 2 Continuous variables of a scatter plot, 1 categorical and one continuous variable for a bar plot). Also learend about how to program and interpret a violin plot in R.
# Lab 3
Worked with data on Facebook. Used figures to determine amount of interaction, hour of the day with the most users online, number of links visited, etc.
# Lab 4
Worked with data on Weather. Learned about how to use the group_by and summarise function. Also learned about how to use different color palette's. 
# Lab 5
Learned aboout web scrapping and how to extract data from a website (indeed.com) and clean the obtained data. Created visualizations with the data optained through web-scrapping.
# Lab 6
Worked with data on North Carolina Births. Learned about the hypothesis test,p-value,and density plots and how to program it. Repeated same new concpets with data on white-wine quality. 
# Lab 7
Worked with data on Vinho Verde. Learned about Test and Train data and how to conduct simple Machine Learning. Learned about classification trees and how to interpret them.
