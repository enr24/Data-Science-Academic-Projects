Intro to statistical data science, using computing tools to gather, manage and analyze large and complex data sets. Topics include data wrangling and formatting, web scraping, data analysis, statistical modeling techniques, text mining and language processing (Creighton University Catalog).
All Programming Work was completed in R.
# Lab 1
Worked with data on Baby Names. Learned about how to program bar graphs and scatter plots. Also learend about how call a dataset and filter it on certain criteria (i.e. a specific name).
# Lab 2
Worked with data on Pokemon figures. Learned how use the mutate function and when its approriate to use certain graphs (i.e 2 Continuous variables of a scatter plot, 1 categorical and one continuous variable for a bar plot). Also learend about how to program and interpret a violin plot in R.
# Lab 3
Worked with data on Facebook. Used figures to determine amount of interaction, hour of the day with the most users online, number of links visited, etc.
# Lab 4
Worked with data on Weather. Learned about how to use the group_by and summarise function. Also learned about how to use different color palette's. 
# Lab 5
Learned aboout web scrapping and how to extract data from a website (indeed.com) and clean the obtained data. Created visualizations with the data optained through web-scrapping.
# Lab 6
Worked with data on North Carolina Births. Learned about the hypothesis test,p-value,and density plots and how to program it. Repeated same new concpets with data on white-wine quality. 
# Lab 7
Worked with data on Vinho Verde wine. Learned about Test and Train data and how to program simple Machine Learning algorithms. Learned about classification trees, decision trees, and random forests and how to interpret them. Goal was to predict which wines would be high-quality vs low-quality.
# Lab 8
Worked with email data. Learend about K-nearest neighbors and artifical nerual networks to try and predict which emails would be considered spam vs which ones were not. 
# Lab 9
Worked with United States Crime Data. Learned about Principal Compnents Analysis and how to program it. Also learned about clustering and distance matrix.
# Mini-Project 1
Worked with data on Marvel Characters and DC Characters. Compared the two datasets to see which dataset had more male characters vs female cahracters and which dataset has more frequent characters(Made an apperance more than 100 times). Also dtermined what was the most common eye-color for the frequent characters.
# Mini-Project 2
Applied webscrapping data on profootball reference and extracted data on passing yards leaders. Wanted to see if the leaders passing yards decreased or increased over the years. 
# Mini-Project 3
Worked with data on credit cards. Applied basic Machine-Learning concepts to the dataset (Test,Train,Random Forest, Tree Model).
# Mini-Project 4
Worked with Southwest Airlines and Alaska Airlines Fleet information. Wanted to see which carrier had the younger fleet and which one was truly "All Boeing".
# Final Project
Worked with data on Airplane crashes. Wanted to see which airplane model (Boeing 737, Airbus A330) and which airline had the most fatalities amongst passengers and crew members.
