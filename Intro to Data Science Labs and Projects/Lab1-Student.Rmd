The main goal of this lab is to show

(1). Some Basic introduction to R markdown options

(2). How to apply basic R skills to a real dataset

As the semester goes on, you're encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better data scientist. Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.

# Getting started

Each of your labs will begin with the following steps. 

- Download the RMarkdown document from the assignment page in BlueLine. Save this to your "Labs" folder.
- Open the RMarkdown document in RStudio.
- Change the author name to your name.

## R Markdown Basics

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Baby names over time

The `R` package `babynames` provides data about the popularity of individual baby names from the US Social Security Administration. Data includes all names used at least 5 times in a year beginning in 1880.

```{r}
#install.packages("babynames")
library(babynames)
str(babynames)
```

Let's track the popularity of a particular name: _Robin_.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#install.packages(tidyverse)
library(tidyverse)

# What does this line do?
#babynames %>% filter(name=='Robin')
```

Use the `ggplot()` command from the `tidyverse` and `ggplot2` libraries (`ggplot2` is contained in the `tidyverse` - more later) to make a plot of name popularity over time.

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
# What does this line do?
filtered_names <- babynames %>% filter(name=='Robin')

# What does this line do?
ggplot(data=filtered_names, aes(x=year, y=prop)) +
  geom_point()
```

Why there are two lines?

```{r}
# How has the plot changed?
ggplot(data=filtered_names, aes(x=year, y=prop, colour = sex)) + geom_point()
```

Let's make this more presentation-ready by adding axis labels.

```{r}
# How has the plot changed?
ggplot(data=filtered_names, aes(x=year, y=prop, colour=sex)) + geom_line() + xlab('Year') + ylab('Prop. of Babies Named Robin')
```

What if we add "Robert"?

```{r}
# 
filtered_names2 <- babynames %>% filter(name %in% c('Robin', 'Robert'))


ggplot(data=filtered_names2, aes(x=year, y=prop)) +
geom_line(aes(colour=sex)) +
xlab('Year') +
ylab('Prop. of Babies Named Robin/Robert')
```

Why the plot is so crazy?

```{r}
filtered_names3 <- babynames %>% 
  filter(name %in% c('Robin', 'Robert')) %>%
  group_by(year, sex) %>% 
  summarise(prop = sum(prop))

ggplot(data=filtered_names3, aes(x=year, y=prop)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour=sex)) +
  xlab('Year') +
  ylab('Prop. of Babies Named Robin/Robert')

#What is the difference between the two plots?
ggplot(data=filtered_names2, aes(x=year, y=prop)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=sex, linetype = name)) +
  xlab('Year') +
  ylab('Prop. of Babies Named Robin/Robert')
```

## Selected names over time

What other names should we try?

Has _Game of Thrones_ added new names to the lexicon?

(This part is an example for the more advanced visualization. Not required for this lab submission.)

```{r}
filtered_names <- babynames %>% filter(name %in% c('Arya'))

ggplot(data=filtered_names, aes(x=year, y=prop)) + 
  geom_line(aes(colour=sex)) + xlab('Year') +
  ylab('Prop. of Babies Named Arya') +
  geom_curve(x=2011, xend=2000, y=0.0002, yend=0.0007, colour='darkgrey') +
  geom_text(x=1995, y=0.0007, label='First episode of \n "Game of Thrones"', colour='black') +
  geom_curve(x=1996, xend=1990, y=0.00003, yend=0.0004, colour='darkgrey') +
  geom_text(x=1990, y=0.0005, label='"A Song of Ice and Fire" \n is published', colour='black')
```

What about popular songs, such as "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
filtered_names <- babynames %>% filter(name %in% c('Rudolph'))
ggplot(data=filtered_names, aes(x=year, y=prop)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour=sex)) + xlab('Year') + ylab('Prop. of Babies Named Rudolph') +
  geom_curve(x=1939, xend=1970, y=0.0006, yend=0.0010, colour='darkgrey') +
  geom_text(x=1980, y=0.0011, label='"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"', colour='black')
```

## Try your own! 

Write the code below to track some names of your choice.

```{r}
# Write your code here: copying/pasting is okay!
filtered_name <- babynames %>% filter(name %in% c('Emmanuel'))
ggplot(data=filtered_name, aes(x=year, y=prop)) +
geom_line(aes(colour=sex)) +
xlab('Year') + 
ylab('Prop. of Babies Named Emmanuel')

filtered_name2 <- babynames %>% filter(name %in% c('Noel'))
ggplot(data=filtered_name2, aes(x=year, y=prop)) +
geom_line(aes(colour=sex)) +
xlab('Year') + 
ylab('Prop. of Babies Named Noel')

filtered_name3 <- babynames %>% filter(name %in% c('Vincent'))
ggplot(data=filtered_name3, aes(x=year, y=prop)) +
geom_line(aes(colour=sex)) +
xlab('Year') + 
ylab('Prop. of Babies Named Vincent')

filtered_name4 <- babynames %>% filter(name %in% c('Josephine'))
ggplot(data=filtered_name4, aes(x=year, y=prop)) +
geom_line(aes(colour=sex)) +
xlab('Year') + 
ylab('Prop. of Babies Named Josephine')

```
                      Lab summary

In each of the figures, I analyzed the popularity of all of my Family Members Names (Dad, Mom and younger Brother). To do this I first used the filter function, which went into the name table and specified it to the particular name that I wanted. I then used the "ggplot" function to show the trend. I chose to let both the x and y axis to be automatically set up and also made sure to include both sexes. The data was spaced out every 20 years and ended at 2000. Between the 4 names, the names Emmanuel, Vincent, and Noel were not very popular in the 1900's but gained more popularity towards the beginning of the 21st century. The name Josephine however, was a very popular name in the 1900's but declined in popularity towards the beginning of the 21st century. All 4 names were either clearly popular Male(Emmanuel, Noel, and Vincent) or Female names (Josephine) with a very small portion being the opposite sex. It would be interesting to see if very popular Male names increase in popularity while very populr female names have decreased in popularity. 


Also, explore a little more on the Rmarkdown code chunk options. What is the function of "eval=FALSE" in the following chunk? Read <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html> for other options. 

Answer: Setting eval to false is used to prevent code from appearing in the final report.

```{r pressure1, eval=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


You're done with the data analysis exercises! Before you submit your Lab, there are two things I'd like you to do.

1. __Resize your figures:__

Click on the gear icon in on top of the R Markdown document, and select "Output Options..." in the dropdown menu. In the pop up dialogue box go to the Figures tab and change the height and width of the figures, and hit OK when done. Then, knit your document and see how you like the new sizes. Change and knit again and again until you're happy with the figure sizes. Note that these values get saved in the YAML.

You can also use different figure sizes for different figures. To do so click on the gear icon within the chunk where you want to make a change. Changing the figure sizes added new options to these chunks: `fig.width` and `fig.height`. You can change them by defining different values directly in your R Markdown document as well.

2. __Change the look of your report:__

Once again click on the gear icon in on top of the R Markdown document, and select "Output Options..." in the dropdown menu. In the General tab of the pop up dialogue box try out different Syntax highlighting and theme options. Hit OK and knit your document to see how it looks. Play around with these until you're happy with the look.

When you're finished, knit the document a final time, and submit the resulting HTML file in BlueLine.
